# TransQuest at WMT2020: Sentence-Level Direct Assessment (Ranasinghe et al., 2020)

This page describes the steps to train the models from [TransQuest at WMT2020: Sentence-Level Direct Assessment (Ranasinghe et al., 2020)](https://aclanthology.org/2020.wmt-1.122/).

## WMT20 Shared Task on Quality Estimation - Task 1

1. Run `train.sh` to train a model using the data from the Shared Task.
3. Run `predict.sh` to generate predictions using the fine-tuned model on test data, and compute evaluation metrics.

Make sure to change the paths in each scripts accordingly.
