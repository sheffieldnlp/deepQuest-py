# Active Learning for Word-Level Quality Estimation

Our main goal is to improve the identification of adequacy-oriented errors in an sceneario with insufficient data manually-annotated with this type of errors.
We experiment with different acquisition functions in an active learning setup to investigate whether we can select instances that are more suitable for training a word-level Quality Estimation model.
